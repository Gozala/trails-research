# Introducing Excer.pt

xcr.pt is a small sharp tool we hope you'll find useful every day.

xcr.pt (pronounced excerpt) allows you to select some text, or an image, press a button, and immediately get a permanent link to that content you can share with anyone, anywhere.

There are no logins, there is no search, and if you lose your excerpt... just take it again.

## How does that work?

When you capture an excerpt, we ask your browser what you current selection is, collect a comment from you, and a snapshot of the page. 

The snapshot is the exact state of your web browser recorded into a file. What's left behind is not the original page, it's sort of a 'preserved in formaldehyde' version. Very much dead, but unlikely to decay and easy to observe. We strip out all the Javascript, inline all the CSS and images, and keep the resulting code. Anything that was in your DOM at the moment of capture will be saved forever. Anything that wasn't, well, it isn't kept at all.

Then, we take those pieces, combine them together, and save them to our cloud API, xcr.pt where you can link them from anywhere.

## Why not just use links?

Links change! The link you send today can show something else (or nothing at all) tomorrow. Links can show different information dependent on your recipient's location than when you sent it. A link can also require a login to see, one you might not want to share for all kinds of reasons.
