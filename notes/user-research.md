# Target Users

## Martin Kleppmann

Computer scientist. Uses Papers.app for his research references, and Evernote to store text notes. Often his notes are sketchy / transitory, but he has some longer notes where he keeps interesting references over time and occasionally shares them. References are important to Martin because citations are the reputational currency of academia.

## Szymon Kaliski

Musician / creator. Szymon has an elaborate collection of text tools that he has built for himself.
His notes all live in one folder and are organized by project. He keeps work logs with timestamps and
adds todo notes which are automatically surfaced with deadlines elsewhere. He has as strong preference for 
plaintext and is uncomfortable putting data into a system that doesn't integrate with his existing tools.

## Cade

Designer / security researcher. Cade uses DevonTHINK to aggregate writing & web sources into his own creative environment. He subscribes to RSS feeds and Twitter feeds for interesting groups / people so that he's automatically ingesting references that can enable him to make connections within content as he writes.

## Robin Sloan
