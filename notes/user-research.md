# Conclusions / Summary So Far
---

Effective thinkers use a variety of tools, often ones of their own devising.

No two creators have the same workflow.

There is a skepticism, generally, about GTD tools.

A definitive central repository of writing is a common tool.

A linear worklog is a common tool.

Thorough note-taking is very common.

# Target Users

## Martin Kleppmann

Computer scientist. Uses Papers.app for his research references, and Evernote to store text notes. Often his notes are sketchy / transitory, but he has some longer notes where he keeps interesting references over time and occasionally shares them. References are important to Martin because citations are the reputational currency of academia.

## Szymon Kaliski

Musician / creator. Szymon has an elaborate collection of text tools that he has built for himself.
His notes all live in one folder and are organized by project. He keeps work logs with timestamps and
adds todo notes which are automatically surfaced with deadlines elsewhere. He has as strong preference for 
plaintext and is uncomfortable putting data into a system that doesn't integrate with his existing tools.

Inbox and then weekly review & synthesis. Learning means putting things into my own words. Curation is essential, keeping everything is gratuitous. Szymon uses a file called "inbox" within his personal wiki system of interlinked markdown files.

Indexing? Not sure how well this would work. Trying to keep notes to a single subject, which can be difficult. Titling is hard. After a while, the titles become a reference to a concept. I can then compose ideas on a different level -- the concepts are abstracted in a useful way. Trying to find the backlink might be hard. Workflow & library. The key between my own material and other's material is important. The dream of memex is that those are the same things. TAKEAWAY: key to separate created content & consumed content. [Irakli feels similarly: based on objective, I might not want to see kinds of references] Symon likes "idea pointers" term.

What about LSP for your wiki?

Let's look at the wiki
---
Here's the webview, I mostly interface through vim. 
Reference documents are Szymon digesting and extracting insight from topics. 
Zettels are things to think about. Memex is some links. Automatic back-links based on titles works. We also transclude back-links. Currently erring on the side of too much context. Opens too many tabs.

Why a webpage and not vim?

## Cade

Designer / security researcher. Cade uses DevonTHINK to aggregate writing & web sources into his own creative environment. He subscribes to RSS feeds and Twitter feeds for interesting groups / people so that he's automatically ingesting references that can enable him to make connections within content as he writes.

## Robin Sloan

# Historical References

## Journals
The simplest and least-formal approach to gathering information. These are generally time-ordered personal recollections of life and work on any given day.

## Commonplace Books


## Engineering Notebooks

## Bullet Journaling
