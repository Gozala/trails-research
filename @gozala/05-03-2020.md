# March 5

Last night I worked on [xcrpt extension][]. Resurrected some code from [web cards][] concept in the   [browser.html][] history and integrated it into extension. Clicking a toolbar button brings up a web card and archived view of the page.

Now (11AM) focusing on generating card from the selection. I remember having done some work on this in the past, and every solution had it's drawbacks:

- [Highlighting selection by enclosing nodes][highlight-by-wrapping] altered DOM. And given that selection was represented through multiple nodes it is not really possible to change color of highlight on hover (without adding JS code which we do not want to do)
- [Drawing selection with SVG overlay][highlight-ancestor] addressed problem of scattered nodes however it relied on `z-index` which can be error prone.
- [DOM Selection <â€“> Resource Selector][capture-restore-selection] attempted to capture selection as a [Resource Selector][] from [Web Annotations][] specification and to create [DOM Selection][] from [Resource Selector][].

I am realizing I need to spend more time reading on [Web Annotations][] as it is clearly relevant to what we are doing here.

Yesterday [@pvh][] mentioned wanting to capture selections in a URLs our xcrpt will have.  Which reminded me of the [thread on twitter][portals-twitter-thread] and a [ScrollToTextFragment][] web platform proposal to allow specifying a text snippet in a URL fragment. I think we should look into it and consider how it fits with this work and learn what is already out there.



Going over the [Web Annotations][] spec I think we should capture / store selections in the format that follows the specification and will look something along the following lines

```json
{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
  "id": "https://xcr.pt/${uuid}",
  "created": "2020-03-05T20:30:47.519Z",
  "generator": "https://exr.pt",
  "type": "Annotation",
  "motivation": "commenting",
  "body": {
    "type": "TextualBody",
    "value": "This seems relevant to our research"
  },
  "target": {
    "type": "SpecificResource",
    "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex",
    "selector": {
		  "type": "CssSelector",
		  "value": "#mw-content-text",
		  "refinedBy": {
    		"type": "TextQuoteSelector",
        "exact": "The memex would have features other than linking",
       	"prefix": "",
        "suffix": "The user could record new information on microfilm"
  		}
		}
  }
}
```
