# March 2

Given outlined milestones in [PROP-2020-1 research trails][research trails] I made an assumption that project would require content capturing component regardless of overall system architecture. I spend day putting together an HTTP service providing REST API for archiving web page/site using [freeze-dry][]. Which could be exposed by local application or be deployed in cloud

```js
const request = fetch(`http://localhost:8081/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex`)
```

In the process I faced many challenges:

- [freeze-dry][] assumes globals (like `Blob`, `fetch`, `FileReader`) present on the web that do not exist on node.
- [node-fetch][] provides some of those globals but is not fully web compatible that causes problems in some edge-cases.
- Sometimes `fetch`-ed content [has wrong content type][content-type-bug].
