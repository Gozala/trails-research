# April 22

After discussing questions with @pvh (yesterday) we have decided to do following:

- Save all the content (we can worry about problems later).
- Expose keywords & score of the matches in results.

Wrote a patch to expose keywords / score with results

![image-20200422121826566](image-20200422121826566.png)

As shown in the above screenshot keywords extracted are pretty naive ‚òπÔ∏è, looking into this to see if there are opportunities to improve this.

[Tique][] provides a way to customize top terms picked as keywords through [`tique::topterms::KeywordAcceptor`][] based on following parameters

- Term frequency: How often has the given term appeared in the input.
- Document frequency: How many documents in the index contain this term.
- Index size: How many documents are in the index in total.

This seems useful, but appears to me that what we need to tweak is a tokenizer.

---

Updated tokenizer to make use of [stopwords][], however I am not seeing expected results as following query `{ similar(input:"I am me") { keywords } }` still produces following output, even though all of the keywords are stopwords.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "similar": {
      "keywords": [
        "am",
        "me",
        "i"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Investigating into this üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Turns out [Tique][] was not picking up schema changes because it reads schema from own index that is written to disk first time it is created. After `rm -rf ~/.knowledge-service/tantivy  ` things works as expected.
