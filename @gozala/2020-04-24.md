# April 24

Spend time looking into [Tantivy][] and [Tique][] documentation & source code to figure how to omit source page from results without filtering it on client end. Notes about my findings:

- [`tique::topterms::TopTerms::extract_filtered`][] can be provided [`tique::topterms::KeywordAcceptor`][] to choose whether to accept the term as keyword or not. It is passed a document frequency (how many documents in the index contain this term). We could skip terms that are only in one document. However that is pretty crude approach as keyword might be popular on it's own and that isn't going to change the fact that input is going to be most similar to the source document.

- Extracted keywords are turned into a [`tantivy::query::BooleanQuery`][] via [`tique::topterms::Keywords::into_query`][] which is used to search index. It appears such queries are composable. So current plan is to compose keywords query with the one that excludes documents with matching `source_url`:

  ```rust
  let query = BooleanQuery::from(vec![
    (Occur::Must, &keywords.clone().into_query()),
    (Occur::Must, TermQuery::new(
      Term::from_field_text(url, &source_url),
      IndexRecordOption::Basic,
  	))
  ]);
  let top = searcher.search(&query, &TopDocs::with_limit(limit))?;
  ```
