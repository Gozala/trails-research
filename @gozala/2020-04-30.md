# April 30

Decided to start enhancing inline double-dagger experience first by surfacing siblinks tooltip on hover (mostly because most building blocks are already in place just need to wire them up).

<center>Hovering ‡ shows tooltip with top 3 siblinks</center>

![Expand x-ray](./Screen Shot 2020-04-30 at 1.18.37 PM.png)

<center>Clicking the ‡ brings expands it further</center>



Now page stays interactive even the x-ray view so you can scroll through the page. If you hover another `‡` it will even update content on the sidebar to reflect that.
