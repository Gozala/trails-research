# March 3

Had a Research Trails [kickoff meeting][] with [@pvh][]. Among other things we brainstormed several implementation strategies for this system.  In an attempt to compare pros / cons of discussed options I have produced document describing possible [system architecture](../Architecture). In the process it became clear that splitting system into smaller components provided a better view for assessing differences.

After getting a feedback from [@pvh][] tomorrow, I'll choose an option and start prototyping a basic proof of concept for collaborative note posting.

#### Open Questions

- How can two people join their research trails ? 
  - It seems that it would be best to have each write into their own and read from the other to avoid conflicts. UX of this seems challenging. 
  - Alternatively we can just agree that each participant is writing into designated directory. This however may prevent us from joining two different research trails.
