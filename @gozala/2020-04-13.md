After chatting with @pvh we have identified following high priority tasks to focus on:

- Fix strange queuing behavior that sometimes causes results from previous page to show up in the next page user navigated to while query was process by server.
- Do not have multiple backlinks to the same resource. It is both confusing and not helpful.
- Preserver URL query parameters of the resource, otherwise backlinks to stack overflow, google, etcâ€¦ point to top level domains instead of anything useful.
- Add some logging to the server, so it is more clear what is going on when things are not working as expected.

Addressed discussed tasks as follows:

- Change [`2784318`][] stopped stripping query parameters / hash from link URLs.
- Change [`7ea7cf5`][] started grouping backlinks by the referrer, which addresses the noise created by having multiple backlinks  to same resource, while still making that information available through [`<details>`][].

@pvh was observed that knowledge server was running out of memory, suspecting a leak. I have spend time figuring out what the problem was (memory leaks are not really possibly in Rust). Problem turned out to be that all backlinks would link to the resource itself which caused same resource to be assembled over and over and for hundreds of links on page that caused problems. Which is not uncommon problem in graphql addressed via [DataLoader][] pattern.

Address above problem with changes: [`431ed3e`][], [`d64331d`][], [`8c57efe`][] by fronting data store with a [DataLoader][DataLoader in Rust] which avoids resolving same resource multiple times. This addressed slowness and memory &  CPU usage issues.
