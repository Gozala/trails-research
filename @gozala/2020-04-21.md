Still working on getting initial integration of [tantivy][] into knowledge server. Run into incompatibility issues between [Juniper][], [Tantivy][] and [DataLoader][] libraries. [Juniper][] does not fully support [contexts with lifetimes][context with lifetimes in Juniper] which means no references can be passed, that is problem now because:

1. There be only one instance of [Tantivy][] service.
2. There needs to be a fresh [DataLoader][] for each received request on the server.

Which leads to situation that we need to create new context on each request, but we can't simply clone one (due to single instance requirement) nor we can use reference of service instead doe to [Juniper][]'s lack of support.

After failed attempts to figure out how to overcome [Juniper][] limitations I settled on wrapping service in [`std::sync::Arc`][].

Now that things are compiling I am facing with several open questions/issues:

1. Do we save content for every ingested resource ? Saving every single visited site content to disk does not seem like a great idea.
2. If we just save index we can not really surface anything beyond `url`, `title` and `description` of the resource when showing similar resources. Maybe that is reasonable.
3. If we just save index we can not really query for similar resource without providing content, in other words you could not query just via `url`.
4. [Tantivy][] does not seem to provide [SQLite like multi-process access][multi-processes access in SQLite] to the database, which is a significant drawback to consider. Furthermore it means that our scanner may corrupt database if server is running.
