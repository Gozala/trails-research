# March 4

We've decided to focus on collection of tools that can be incorporated into research instead of building a single application. We decided to start with a tool to improve link sharing experience (posting a URL or a screenshot of the content). Like URL shortener service, but for creating links to clipped web content.

[IPFS][] with a content addressable data storage seems like perfect fit for this (assuming it works reliably). Other alternatives considered being:

- [Gist API][] which does not require logins.
- [Dropbox API][].
- Our own cloud solution.

We could also consider deploying our own IPFS node if using public infrastructure proves to be unreliable that way we'll get benefits of IPFS and own cloud (although it may cost extra).

To keep things simple I'm also exploring https://pinata.cloud/ as a way to store data onto IPFS. Prototyping a simple web app that lets you type content and then publish it to IPFS through [Pinata pinning API][pinata-api]

----

I have created a proof of concept [pinatarium][] web application (Fork of [Peerdium][]). It lets you type a post and publish it to IPFS network using [Pinata API][pinata-api] (It will also preserve a pointer of the original document it was forked from). You can [give it a try][try-pinatarium] here if you like.

Tomorrow I'll try to integrate these pieces with [pushing clipper web-extension fork][clipper].
