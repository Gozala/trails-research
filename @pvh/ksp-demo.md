## User Goal: remember how to style a column of html

I seem to remember there was a CSS property I could use. Something about flexbox.

I Google "css column" and can see which links I've been to before. Clicking on one, I see not just that I've been here before but how often.

I click into the https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ and start reading. Clicking through to:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content

I see in my back-links view that not only have I been to this page before, but there were some Stack Overflow questions I read a while back that linked here too!

A couple of the questions are irrelevant, but I realize one of the questions actually has the answer I've been looking for, and click over there to read it.

Having clicked through, see that I'd previously saved that question in my notes from my last project, read a brief summary of the problem and solution, and head off to "justify-content" appropriately.
