# standup

## irakli
 - selection extraction stuff
 - rereading stuff from back then
 - selection range into WebAnnotation node spec
 - pvh should look at https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/
 - convert range to generated selector but there are lots of kinds and you want the best one and... it's complicated
 - (remember we have a snapshot, which makes life easier with a stable target)
 - eventually trying to actually do it! and that was another rabbit hole
 - is this a chrome issue? cloneContents() on a range has some strange behaviour
 - did get to somewhere!

## pvh
 - prompt popup
 - declarative events
 - moved code around
  
## discussion
 - can we use JS? yes.

## plan for today

 - [p] keep working on prompt implementation
 - [i] create selector & capture it to save
 - [i] add publish
