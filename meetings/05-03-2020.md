# standup
irakli showed demo of clipper working
next steps:
 - [p] ui for adding note
 - [i] add a selection (& capture metadata like time)
 - [i] save to IPFS
 - how to render the excerpted page
 - highlight selection
 - color matching
 - replace freeze-dry inline stuff (defer)

pvh 
- now own xcr.pt
- created heroku app xcrpt
- setting up dns

[i] why a heroku app?
[p] probably need to do some computing on the internet. if nothing else, translating some URLs?

## when we render the page, we want to show the selection in the UI somehow
