## Workshop went well, what's next

More of this or something new? More of this.

Three paths forward: 
 * more front-ends (VSCode / Slack / &c)
 * more capabilities (topic extraction, sentiment, &c)
 * polish & write

Add topic extraction -- seems very high value.

### Topic extraction

Discussion of how to do it. Peter worried about having a per-data format topic extraction code. 
Markdown, HTML, Google Docs, whatever, all different.
Irakli argued, hey, let's just get something working. Good call.

Tyler Angert asked if we were "just going to do a quick tf-idf thing", so yea, that seems promising.
Let's talk to him about it.

Looks like there's a rust implementation of (tf-idf)[https://github.com/ferristseng/rust-tfidf
], but it's super old and abandoned.

### Dogsheep

Blaine mentioned Simon Willison is working on something similiar. Let's talk to him. (Peter to reach out.)

## Paragraph Tagging Sidebar

Also, Szymon's "tag a paragraph" request is very interesting, potentially useful.
Should this be an xcrpt feature? Maybe. Probably implies xcrpt redesigns to support.
