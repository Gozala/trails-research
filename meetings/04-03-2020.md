## standup

Peter didn't accomplish too much yesterday due to exhaustion & falling asleep early. Did get contract over to Adam.
Irakli wrote notes up (in this repo!) and was working on archivist.

## planning

Which of the four design options in Irakli's architecture docs do we like? Peter is fine with all four, but the agreed-upon ranked preference was: local-execution with shared folder, dropbox API, cloud 

## decisions

Focus on a "tools not apps" mentality. Don't build a thing to solve all the things. Build little pieces that can work together or be used apart.

Build a URL excerpter as a first tool along the path.


## goals

Peter to sketch link excerpter tool.
Irakli to explore IPFS / Dropbox APIs as possible storage options.
